📘 Approximation AlgorithmsThis repository contains implementations of classical approximation algorithms for NP-Hard optimization problems. Written in C++, it serves as a practical codebase for students and developers to understand how theoretical approximation guarantees are realized in practice.📁 Repository StructureThe project is organized by problem, with each directory containing the implementation for a specific algorithm:Bin Packing/: Algorithms for the Bin Packing problemKnapsack/: Algorithms for the Knapsack problem (0/1 and FPTAS variants)Max Cut/: Algorithms for the Maximum Cut problem in graphsMetric TSP/: Approximation algorithms for the Metric Traveling Salesperson ProblemSet Cover/: Implementations for the Set Cover problemSteiner Tree/: Algorithms for the Steiner Tree problem in graphsVertex Cover/: Classic algorithms (e.g., greedy, 2-approximation) for the Vertex Cover problem🛠️ Technology StackLanguage: C++ (100% of the repository)Focus: Algorithmic clarity, correctness, and demonstrating approximation ratios🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesC++ compiler (g++ or compatible)Basic knowledge of algorithms and data structuresCompilation and ExecutionClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/arjunaggarwaliit/Approximation-Algorithms.git](https://github.com/arjunaggarwaliit/Approximation-Algorithms.git)
cd Approximation-Algorithms
Navigate to a specific problem directory:cd "Vertex Cover"  # or any other algorithm directory
Compile the C++ source files:g++ -std=c++11 -o algorithm_name main.cpp  # adjust filename as needed
Run the executable:./algorithm_name
